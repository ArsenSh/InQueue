            When you book an appointment through our Service, you will receive a confirmation with an activation code.
            This code is necessary to manage your appointment and serves as authentication for accessing appointment details.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for safeguarding your activation code. Activities that occur using your activation code
            are your responsibility. You must notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your
            activation code.

          <p>
            <strong>Appointment Confirmation:</strong> After booking an appointment, you will receive a confirmation with
            an activation code and QR code. You may be required to present this at the bank branch.

        <!-- Cancellation and Modification Policy -->
        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>5. Cancellation and Modification Policy</h2>
          <p>
            You may modify or cancel your appointment through our Service up to one hour before the scheduled time.
            For changes less than one hour before your appointment, you must contact the bank branch directly.
          </p>
          <h3>Lateness Policy:</h3>
          <p>
            If you expect to be late for your appointment, you can notify the bank through our Service. Depending on
            the bank's policies and availability, your appointment may be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rescheduled for a later time on the same day</li>
            <li>Honored upon your arrival, subject to wait times</li>
            <li>Cancelled if you are more than 30 minutes late without notification</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>No-Show Policy:</strong> Failure to attend your appointment without cancellation may result in
            temporary limitations on your ability to book future appointments through our Service.

        <!-- Availability and Service Limitations -->
        <section class="terms-section">
          <h2>6. Service Availability and Limitations</h2>
          <p>
            The InQueue Service allows you to book appointments up to one month in advance. Availability is dependent
            on each partner bank's operating hours and staffing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to ensure that all available time slots shown on our platform are accurate, but we cannot
            guarantee availability in the event of technical issues, bank scheduling changes, or other circumstances
            beyond our control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weekend appointments are generally not available, as reflected in our booking calendar.
